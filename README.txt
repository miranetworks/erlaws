Erlaws provides Erlang interfaces to various Amazon WebService offerings.

= Description = 
Erlaws is a collection of client implementations of Amazon's WebServices offerings. Currently there are clients for EC2, S3, SQS and SDB.

= Build =

Issue `erl -make` to build the sources.
If you get 'error write file' errors, do `mkdir ebin`.

= Usage =

All erlaws modules (erlaws_s3, _sdb, _sqs, _ec2) are now parameterized modules. You can create a new instance of a modules using (example for erlaws_sdb):

SDB = erlaws_sdb:new(AWS_KEY, AWS_SEC_KEY, (true|false)).

The last parameter determines whether the connection should made using plain HTTP (false) or HTTPS (true).

In order to be able to use erlaws the "inets", "crypto" and "ssl" applications must be started.

= Documentation =

All available functions are documented in the .erl files for the service clients.
